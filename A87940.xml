            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From AMSTERDAM To <hi>M. C.</hi> in <hi>LONDON.</hi> Diſcovering the taking of Sr. Thomas Armſtrong With the narrow Eſcape of My Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eerguſon</hi> at LEYDEN IN HOLLAND.</head>
            <p>WE live in an Age not over prone to admire and take notice of any Inſtances of Divine Providence either in our Preſervation from dangers, our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of them, or our falling into them, for ſo great is the ſecurity of ſome Men that they are unwilling to apprehend any danger till they fall into it, and if they eſcape for a time will hardly believe that they were ever in it.</p>
            <p>Such is the Caſe of this ungrateful Rebel, an Arch Traytor, Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong,</hi> who having eſcaped the hands of Juſtice for a time thought himſelf ſecure, but the hand of Providence that has in Mercy protected our moſt Gracious Soveraign from all Wicked Devices, hath at laſt in Juſtice lay'd hold on this deſperate Renegade, and will in time bring him to juſt and Exemplary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>The nature and manner of his being taken, being then my ſelf at <hi>Leydon</hi> the ſame day, I will Diſcover as ſhort as I can.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> with the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lain ſome Months at <hi>Berlin</hi> &amp; being ſuſpected upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Privacy, we had notice ſent by <hi>Juan van Farrenberg,</hi> at whoſe Houſe they then lay, of ſome ſuſpected Perſons, <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154035:2"/>Men, that had lain in his Houſe for ſome time by the name of <hi>Bowman, Bethel</hi> and <hi>Jekiel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chudly,</hi> his Majeſties Envoy at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> having notice thereof made his Application to the States for a Warrant to ſeize them which was granted, but before they got to <hi>Berlin</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had private Information or their Fears ſuggeſted) they were remov'd, and got to <hi>Bremond,</hi> there they ſtayed a while, and might have ſtayed longer had not their zeal or curioſity to ſee the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> engaged them to take a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramage into <hi>Fanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this they came to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where having ſupply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Trowling Money (for the Bully at this time had thrown away his falſe Dice) they went to <hi>Leyden</hi> which is 12 miles from <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they had not been 3 days when the Envoy having again notice of it procur'd a Warrant for the ſecureing of them. Whither they had any Information, or ſuſpected any thing, the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> made their eſcapes. But Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> reſolving to Dye upon the ſpot before he was taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to ſtay longer.</p>
            <p>The Perſons ſent to ſeize him, being ſo Commanded by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, were reſolved to take him if poſſible alive. For which Cauſe they made no attempt upon his Lodging, but having notice, he was to go by Water, they poſted themſelves for his Reception at the place where he was to take Boat. Where after they had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4 days, at laſt they ſpyed him coming, who was no ſooner in the Boat but 4 of them leapt in after him and the reſt in another Boat ſo ſecur'd him that he cou'd neither do them nor himſelf any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, though he ſeveral times declar'd he wou'd ſonner be kill'd then taken, drew out his Knife to Stab himſelf, and attempted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to throw himſelf over Board.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſecured and prevented him from doing any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif to himſelf, they ſoon made to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where one of his Majeſties Yats was ready to receive them. On Board of which he is now coming to <hi>London</hi> faſt bound in Chains for fear of doing Violence to himſelf, where you may expect him in a ſhort time, and it is expected the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon</hi> will follow in a few days after, they being now in cloſe ſearch of them.</p>
